## Inspiration
ChartGenie was inspired by the need for an intuitive, automated solution to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations. Current tools often require manual configuration or advanced technical expertise. With ChartGenie, we leverage AI to simplify the process, making data insights accessible to everyone.

---

## What It Does
ChartGenie is an AI-powered platform that extracts data from user inputs (e.g., CSV, text) and generates beautiful, customizable charts. 

**Key Features:**
- **Data Extraction**: Seamlessly process raw data using AI to extract meaningful information.
- **Chart Generation**: Create real-time, interactive charts using Chart.js.
- **User Authentication**: Manage secure user accounts with Clerk.
- **3D Visualizations**: Integrate stunning 3D designs using Spline.
- **Personalized Insights**: Utilize OpenAI API to provide data-driven suggestions.
- **Vector Database**: Store and retrieve embeddings for user-specific queries using Pinecone.

---

## How We Built It
ChartGenie integrates cutting-edge technologies into a cohesive system:

- **Frontend**: Built using Next.js, ShadCN, and Tailwind CSS for responsive and accessible design.
- **Backend**: Node.js powers the API layer for OpenAI and Pinecone interactions.
- **Database**: Firebase stores user data securely, while Pinecone handles vectorized embeddings.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API processes user queries and provides recommendations.
- **3D Design**: Spline enhances user experience with visually appealing 3D elements.

---

## Challenges We Ran Into
- **Embedding Management**: Ensuring the embeddings stored in Pinecone aligned with user-specific data queries.
- **Chart Customization**: Achieving flexibility in Chart.js configurations for diverse user needs.
- **Authentication Integration**: Seamlessly integrating Clerk while maintaining a smooth user experience.

---

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- Successfully integrated AI-powered data extraction and real-time chart generation.
- Developed a responsive and visually appealing UI using ShadCN and Tailwind CSS.
- Implemented secure user authentication with Clerk.
- Integrated Pinecone for vector database functionality to enhance query handling.

---

## What We Learned
- Leveraging vector databases like Pinecone to optimize AI-driven data retrieval.
- Best practices for integrating third-party authentication (Clerk) into a full-stack application.
- Advanced Chart.js configurations for dynamic visualizations.
- Effective use of OpenAI API for natural language processing.

---

## What's Next for ChartGenie
- **Enhanced Data Sources**: Support for additional data formats (e.g., APIs, Google Sheets).
- **Collaboration Features**: Enable team-based chart collaboration and sharing.
- **Customizable Templates**: Offer pre-built chart templates for quicker insights.
- **Scalability**: Optimize backend and hosting for handling larger datasets.
